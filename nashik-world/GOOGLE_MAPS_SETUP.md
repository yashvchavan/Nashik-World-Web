# Google Maps Setup for Nashik World

## Prerequisites

1. A Google Cloud Platform account
2. A Google Maps API key

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get a Google Maps API Key

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and add:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Restrict Your API Key (Recommended)

For security, restrict your API key:

1. In Google Cloud Console, go to "Credentials"
2. Click on your API key
3. Under "Application restrictions", select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
4. Add your domain (e.g., `localhost:3000/*` for development)
5. Under "API restrictions", select "Restrict key"
6. Select only the APIs you need (Maps JavaScript API, Places API)

### 4. Test the Integration

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the home page
3. You should see the Google Maps with Nashik civic issues

- Optimize marker rendering by limiting the number of visible markers

## Next Steps

1. Replace sample data with real Firebase data
2. Add marker clustering for better performance
3. Implement real-time location updates
4. Add street view integration
5. Implement directions to issues
